                    I'm a life-long fan of downtrotted teams the Knickerbockers, and the New York Football Jets. I love
                    riddles even though I'm bad at them. I love movies and believe I could have made it as a C list
                    actor.

                <p>
                    Since my early teenage years in the late 90's I've been enamored with the 'Net' as we called it back
                    then. I never really gave thought to why we called it the Net or the Web until recently, but that
                    name holds true more than anything I've ever heard. The Internet changed my life as well as everyone
                    else's life as we use it for everything. I remember sites back in the day tracking private islands
                    for sale and saying one day that will be me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ability to create value and wealth from seemingly nothing had me shocked. Somehow I always knew
                    that I
                    wanted to be involved with the creation of our online world. This is what lead me to Web
                    Development,
                    and my unending quest to learn as much as I can to be creative and add value for others.
